I got a monster in my closet. Someone's underneath my bed. The wind's knocking at my window. I'd kill it but it's already dead. At first I was scared when I looked at his eyes but now that I know him I'm not that surprised. I'm just waiting on the sun to rise. Oh how I wish that old sun would rise.
